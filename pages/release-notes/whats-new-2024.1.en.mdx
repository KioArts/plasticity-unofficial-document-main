### Export Dialog

The export dialog now has an improved functionality where it retains the last used filename. This means that when you export a file, the software will automatically suggest the name you previously used, streamlining the process and saving you time. This feature is particularly useful for those who frequently export files with similar or iterative names, as it reduces the need to re-enter the filename each time. This enhancement not only increases efficiency but also minimizes the risk of errors from manually typing filenames repeatedly

### Image/OBJ Import

Introducing a feature that automatically names imported image and OBJ files based on their original import filename. This means that when you import a file, the software will use the existing filename as the default name within the application. This feature ensures consistency and makes it easier to organize and locate your files, as their names remain unchanged from their source. This automatic naming helps maintain a clear and organized workflow, especially when dealing with multiple files, as it eliminates the need to manually rename each file after import.

### Tangent Circle Command

Extended the Tangent Circle command to construct tangents to three curves/edges. Refer to [here](/tool/tangent-circle).
The Tangent Circle command now supports constructing tangents to three curves or edges. This enhancement allows users to create a circle that is tangent to three different curves or edges at once, improving versatility and precision in complex designs. Refer to [here](/tool/tangent-circle).
### New shaders and Built-In Matcaps

Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis and new built-in matcaps for advanced surfacing workflows, including the option to insert custom matcaps. Refer to [here](/plasticity-essential/view-mode).

### Patch Command 

Patch Command now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole and trim main sheet to align with the end section of the base sheet. For more information, click [here](/solid/patch).

<VideoPlayer fileName="patch-5"/>

### Untrim 

Untrim Command has been enhanced to create holes instead of only duplicating. For more information of the Untrim Command, click [here](/solid/untrim).

<VideoPlayer fileName="untrim-example"/> 

### Extend Curve

Extend Curve command expanded to accept curves in addition to vertices, extending in two directions simultaneously. 

<VideoPlayer fileName="extend-curve-example"/>

### Join Sheet

Join Sheets Command can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet. For more information on Join Sheet Command, click [here](/solid/join-sheets).

<VideoPlayer fileName="join-sheet-example"/>

### Extend Sheet

Introducing a new behavior for the Extend Sheet Command which will extend a sheet up to and intersecting a target body. For more information on Extend Sheet, click [here](/solid/extend-sheet).

<VideoPlayer fileName="dependant-extend-sheet"/> 

### Point Picking Enhancement 

When pressing Shift+X, you can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking on a curve, edge, and solid. This allows you to snap on specific points without slowing you down.

<VideoPlayer fileName="point-picking-enhancement-example"/>

### Snapping Features 

Introduced new edge snaps "closest, perpendicular, and tangent" allowing for more control and precision when working with edges. For more information on grid snapping features click [here](/plasticity-essential/grid-and-snap).

<VideoPlayer fileName="snapping-features-example"/>

Additionally, new hover snaps are introduced where curves and edges intersect or pierce the construction plane and axes. 

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-intersection-curve-edges-example"/>

### Tangent Circle and Arc

Introduced new hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs, allowing for more precise and consistent work. Refer to Tangent Circle [here](/tool/tangent-circle) and Tangent Arc [here](/tool/tangent-arc).

### Measurement Panel 

The measurements panel now displays the angles between two edges, providing precise angular measurements. This update enhances accuracy in analyzing and adjusting the relationships between design elements.

<VideoPlayer fileName="measurement-panel-example"/>

### Outliner

The Outliner's right-click menu now includes an option to create a group with selected items. This new feature allows for easier organization and management of multiple items by grouping them together directly from the context menu

<VideoPlayer fileName="outliner-example"/>

### Construction Plane  

**"Plane from selection"** now allows using surface CVs to create construction planes. For more information about construction planes click [here](/plasticity-essential/construction-plane).

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-example"/>

### OBJ/STL Unit Confirmation

 Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation.

### Improved Panel Interactivity

 Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.

### STEP Export Enhacement

 Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.

### Warning Indicator for Unsaved Files

 A warning for unsaved changes now appears when opening files, along with an indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.

 ![Warning indicator](/img/warning-indicator.png)
 
### Command Palette

 The Command Palette now highlights clashing keybindings in red. This feature makes it easier to identify and resolve conflicts, ensuring smoother workflow and improved usability.

 ![Keybind conflict highlighter](/img/keybind-conflict-highlight.png)

### Pipe Gizmo

 New simplified gizmo for the Pipe command.

 ![Pipe Gizmo](/img/pipe-gizmo-example.png)

### New OBJ Export Option X

 New obj export option: "inflexion".

### OBJ Export Wireframe and Shader X

 Obj export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe. This can be used to check ultra-high-resolution zebras, for example.

### Dimension Command Enhancement X

 Dimension Command can now resize cylinders. 

### Rebuild X

Rebuild Command expanded to replace smoothly connected edges. 

### Planar Face Polygons -x- ---

Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons.


## Major Improvement

### Dependent Offset 

Offset Face (push/pull) command now supports dependent offsets. Refer to [here](/solid/offset-face).

<VideoPlayer fileName="dependant-offset-face"/>

### Raise Surface Degree

Raise Degree Command increases surface complexity by converting analytic surfaces to spline and increasing the spline degree. Refer to [here](/solid/raise-surface-degree).

<VideoPlayer fileName="raise-surface-degree"/>

### Surface CV Editing

Surface CV editing now allows direct manipulation of both trimmed and untrimmed faces.

### Nominal Face

Faces with visible cvs now have a nominal surface to allow easier edits in the presence of direct editing. Remove Nominal Surface Command is available in case it needs to be removed. Refer to [here](/solid/remove-nominal-surface).

<VideoPlayer filename="remove-nominal-surface"/>

### Toggle Points

Introduced Toggle Points command to show/hide points on faces, curves, and bodies. Refer to [here](/curve/toggle-points).

<VideoPlayer fileName="toggle-points"/> 

### Pipe and Sweep

Added scaling options to the Pipe and Sweep commands. Refer to [Pipe](/solid/pipe) and [Sweep](/solid/sweeop) for more details.

### Full Round Fillet

Implemented a "Full Round" fillet option. 

The Full Round option has been added to the solid fillet feature. This option gives you the option to create a rounded fillet on a face when two edges are selected.

For more details on Fillet Shell, see [here](/solid/fillet-shell#fillet-options).

### Face Rebuild

Rebuild command now can rebuild the surfaces of faces; extend/and shrink options allow for easily overbuilding surfaces.

<VideoPlayer fileName="rebuild-face"/>


## Studio-Exclusive Features

### xNURBS

Integrated the xNURBS addon for high-quality surface construction.

The software now integrates the xNURBS addon, enabling high-quality surface construction.
