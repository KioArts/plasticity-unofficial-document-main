Release date: March 5, 2024

## Download and Installation

Plasticity 2024.1 is now available for download. Please refer to [this link](/getting-started/download-and-install) for more details.

## Minor Improvement

### Radial Array 

Improved interactivity of the Radial Array command, allowing you to directly see live interactivity on the viewport and improving your consistency of work. For more information on Radial Array, click [here](/common/radial-array).

<VideoPlayer fileName="radial-array-interaction-update-preview"/>

### Export Dialog

The export dialog now has an improved functionality where it retains the last used filename. This means that when you export a file, Plasticity will automatically suggest the name you previously used, streamlining the process and saving you time.

### Image/OBJ Import

Introducing a feature that automatically names imported image and OBJ files based on their original import filename. This means that when you import a file, Plasticity will use the existing filename as the default name within the application.

### Tangent Circle Command

The Tangent Circle command now supports constructing tangents to three curves or edges. This enhancement allows users to create a circle that is tangent to three different curves or edges at once, improving versatility and precision in complex designs. For more information click [here](/tool/tangent-circle).

### New shaders and Built-In Matcaps

Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis and new built-in matcaps for advanced surfacing workflows, including the option to insert custom matcaps. Refer to [here](/plasticity-essential/view-mode).

### Patch Command 

Patch Command now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole and trim main sheet to align with the end section of the base sheet. For more information, click [here](/solid/patch).

<VideoPlayer fileName="patch-5"/>

### Untrim 

Untrim Command has been enhanced to create holes instead of only duplicating. For more information of the Untrim Command, click [here](/solid/untrim).

<VideoPlayer fileName="untrim-example"/> 

### Extend Curve

Extend Curve command expanded to accept curves in addition to vertices, extending in two directions simultaneously. For more information on Extend Curve, click [here](/sketch/extend-curve).

<VideoPlayer fileName="extend-curve-example"/>

### Join Sheet

Join Sheets Command can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet. For more information on Join Sheet, click [here](/solid/join-sheets).

<VideoPlayer fileName="join-sheet-example"/>

### Extend Sheet

Introducing a new behavior for the Extend Sheet Command which will extend a sheet up to and intersecting a target body. For more information on Extend Sheet, click [here](/solid/extend-sheet#dependant-offset).

<VideoPlayer fileName="extend-sheet-dependant-offset"/> 

### Point Picking Enhancement 

When pressing <kbd>Shift+X</kbd>, you can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking on a curve, edge, and solid. This allows you to snap on specific points without slowing you down.

<VideoPlayer fileName="point-picking-enhancement-example"/>

### Snapping Features 

Introduced new edge snaps "closest, perpendicular, and tangent" allowing for more control and precision when working with edges. For more information on grid snapping features click [here](/plasticity-essential/grid-and-snap).

<VideoPlayer fileName="snapping-features-example"/>

![Edge snapping example](/img/new-edge-snapping.png)

Additionally, new hover snaps are introduced where curves and edges intersect or pierce the construction plane and axes. For more information on construction planes, click [here](/plasticity-essential/construction-plane).

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-intersection-curve-edges-example"/>

![Construction plane intersection example](/img/construction-plane-example.png)

### Tangent Circle and Arc

Introduced new hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs, allowing for more precise and consistent work. Refer to Tangent Circle [here](/tool/tangent-circle) and Tangent Arc [here](/tool/tangent-arc).

### Measurement Panel 

The measurements panel now displays the angles between two edges, providing precise angular measurements. This update enhances accuracy in analyzing and adjusting the relationships between design elements.

<VideoPlayer fileName="measurement-panel-example"/>

### Outliner

The Outliner's right-click menu now includes an option to create a group with selected items. This new feature allows for easier organization and management of multiple items by grouping them together directly from the context menu

<VideoPlayer fileName="outliner-example"/>

![Outliner group right click option](/img/outliner-example.png)

### Construction Plane  

"Plane from selection" now allows using surface CVs to create construction planes. For more information about construction planes click [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane).

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-example"/>

### OBJ/STL Unit Confirmation

 Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation. 

### Improved Panel Interactivity

 Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.

### STEP Export Enhacement

 Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.

### Warning Indicator for Unsaved Files

 A warning for unsaved changes now appears when opening files, along with an indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.

 ![Warning indicator](/img/warning-indicator.png)
 
### Command Palette

 The Command Palette now highlights clashing keybindings in red. This feature makes it easier to identify and resolve conflicts, ensuring smoother workflow and improved usability.

 ![Keybind conflict highlighter](/img/keybind-conflict-highlight.png)

### Simplified Pipe Gizmo

 The Gizmo for the Pipe Command has been simplified, making it now easy to use and work with. Refer to the example below.  

 ![Pipe Gizmo](/img/pipe-gizmo-example.png)

### New OBJ Export Option: "Inflexion"

The "Inflexion" option inserts additional line cuts on surface areas, particularly noticeable on curvatures. This increases topology resolution for higher quality rendering when exported to other 3D packacges. However, you now have the option to disable it for a more evenly distributed topology control overall.

![Inflexion OBJ Option](/img/obj-export-example-1.png)

### OBJ Export Feature: Matcap and Wireframe Options

OBJ export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe during inspection. This feature is useful for checking surface quality or optimization with high-resolution zebra or other shaders. 

 <VideoPlayer fileName="obj-export-example-2"/>

### Dimension Command Enhancement

 Resizing cylinders with the Dimension Command is now possible. For more information on the Dimension Command, click [here](/common/dimension).

 <VideoPlayer fileName="dimension-command-example"/>

### Rebuild Edge

The Rebuild Command has expanded to now rebuild broken edges on a surface. This is useful when manually deleting the edges with <kbd>Shift+X</kbd> and Delete Redundant Topology Command don't work. For more information on Rebuild Command, click [here](/sketch/rebuild).

<VideoPlayer fileName="rebuild-edge"/> 

### Planar Face Polygons

Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons. For more information on Regular Polygon Tool, click here [here](/tool/polygon)


## Major Improvement
