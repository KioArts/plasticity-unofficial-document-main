Release date: March 5, 2024

## Download and Installation

Plasticity 2024.1 is now available for download. Please refer to [this link](/getting-started/download-and-install) for more details.

## Minor Improvement

### Radial Array 

Improved interactivity of the Radial Array command, allowing you to directly see live interactivity on the viewport. More information on Radial Array, click [here](/tool).

<VideoPlayer fileName="radial-array-interaction-update-preview"/>

### Planar Face Polygons -x- ---

Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons.

### Export Dialog

Export dialog now remembers the last used filename.

### Image/OBJ Import

Automatically name imported image/OBJ files based on the original import filename.

### Tangent Circle Command

Extended the Tangent Circle command to construct tangents to three curves/edges. Refer to [here](/tool/tangent-circle).

### New shaders and Built-In Matcaps

Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis and new built-in matcaps for advanced surfacing workflows, including the option to insert custom matcaps. Refer to [here](/plasticity-essential/view-mode).

### Patch Command -

Patch Command now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole.

### Untrim 

Untrim Command has been enhanced to create holes instead of only duplicating. For more information of the Untrim Command, click [here](/solid/untrim).

<VideoPlayer fileName="untrim-example"/> 

### Extend Curve

Extend Curve command expanded to accept curves in addition to vertices, extending in two directions simultaneously. 

<VideoPlayer fileName="extend-curve-example"/>

### Join Sheet

Join Sheets Command can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet. Refer to [here](/solid/join-sheets).

<VideoPlayer fileName="join-sheet-example"/>

### Point Picking Enhancement 

When pressing Shift+X, you can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking on a curve, edge, and solid. This allows you to snap on specific points without slowing you down.

<VideoPlayer fileName="point-picking-enhancement-example"/>

### Snapping Features

Introduced new edge snaps "closest, perpendicular, and tangent" allowing for more control and precision when working with edges. For more information on grid snapping features click here](/plasticity-essential/grid-and-snap).

<VideoPlayer fileName="snapping-features-example"/>

Additionally, new hover snaps are introduced where curves and edges intersect or pierce the construction plane and axes. 

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-intersection-curve-edges-example"/>

### Tangent Circle and Arc

Introduced new hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs, allowing for more precise and consistent work. Refer to Tangent Circle [here](/tool/tangent-circle) and Tangent Arc [here](/tool/tangent-arc).

### Measurement Panel 

The measurements panel now displays angles between two edges.

<VideoPlayer fileName="measurement-panel-example"/>

### Outliner

Outliner's right-click menu includes a new option to create a group with selected items.

<VideoPlayer fileName="outliner-example"/>

### Construction Plane  

"Plane from selection" now allows using surface CVs to create construction planes. For more information about construction planes click [here](/plasticity-essential/construction-plane).

<VideoPlayer fileName="construction-plane-example"/>

### OBJ/STL Unit Confirmation

 Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation.

### Improved Panel Interactivity

 Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.

### Extend Sheet

 Extend Sheet Command introduced an "up to" behavior for extending surfaces.

###  STEP Export Enhacement

 Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.

### Warning Indicator for Unsaved Files

 Added a warning for unsaved changes when opening files as well as a indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.

### Command Palette

 Command Palette now highlights in red clashing keybindings.

### Pipe Gizmo

 New simplified gizmo for the Pipe command.

### New OBJ Export Option

 New obj export option: "inflexion".

### OBJ Export Wireframe and Shader

 Obj export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe. This can be used to check ultra-high-resolution zebras, for example.

### Dimension Command Enhancement

 Dimension Command can now resize cylinders. 

### Rebuild 

Rebuild Command expanded to replace smoothly connected edges. 


## Major Improvement

### Dependent Offset 

Offset Face (push/pull) command now supports dependent offsets. Refer to [here](/solid/offset-face).

<VideoPlayer fileName="dependant-offset-face"/>

### Raise Surface Degree

Raise Degree Command increases surface complexity by converting analytic surfaces to spline and increasing the spline degree. Refer to [here](/solid/raise-surface-degree).

<VideoPlayer fileName="raise-surface-degree"/>

### Surface CV Editing

Surface CV editing now allows direct manipulation of both trimmed and untrimmed faces.

### Nominal Face

Faces with visible cvs now have a nominal surface to allow easier edits in the presence of direct editing. Remove Nominal Surface Command is available in case it needs to be removed. Refer to [here](/solid/remove-nominal-surface).

<VideoPlayer filename="remove-nominal-surface"/>

### Toggle Points

Introduced Toggle Points command to show/hide points on faces, curves, and bodies. Refer to [here](/curve/toggle-points).

<VideoPlayer fileName="toggle-points"/> 

### Pipe and Sweep

Added scaling options to the Pipe and Sweep commands. Refer to [Pipe](/solid/pipe) and [Sweep](/solid/sweeop) for more details.

### Full Round Fillet

Implemented a "Full Round" fillet option. 

The Full Round option has been added to the solid fillet feature. This option gives you the option to create a rounded fillet on a face when two edges are selected.

For more details on Fillet Shell, see [here](/solid/fillet-shell#fillet-options).

### Face Rebuild

Rebuild command now can rebuild the surfaces of faces; extend/and shrink options allow for easily overbuilding surfaces.

<VideoPlayer fileName="rebuild-face"/>


## Studio-Exclusive Features

### xNURBS

Integrated the xNURBS addon for high-quality surface construction.

### Rhino 8 Import

 Added support for Rhino 8 imports.

## Noteworthy Optimizations

Enhanced parallelism in OBJ/STL exports.

Object transformations (move/rotate/scale) now bypass refaceting on confirmation for efficiency.

Implemented 16-bit snorm normals and 16-bit indices where possible to optimize memory usage.


## New Commands 

### Remove Nominal Surface

Remove hiden surface CVs for more control. Only applicable when you've raised surface degree. Refer to [here](/solid/remove-nominal-surface)

### Toggle Points

Toggle on or off CV points on faces, curves, and bodies. Refer to [here](/sketch/toggle-points)

### Rebuild Face

Rebuild a face 

### Raise Degree on Curves and Faces
