# Minor Enhancements

- Improved the interactivity of the Radial Array command.
- Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons.
- Export dialog now remembers the last used filename.
- Automatically name imported image/OBJ files based on the original import filename.
- Introduced a new orbit/rotation strategy using the classic tumble/turntable approach.
- Extended the TangentCircle command to construct tangents to three curves/edges.
- Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis.
- Introduced new built-in matcaps and for advanced surfacing workflows.
- Custom matcaps
- New "ultra" faceting preference to enhance surface smoothness in surfacing workflows- (Use with caution!)
- Command palette now highlights clashing keybindings in red.
- Diagnostic error bodies are now displayed in the Loft and Sweep commands to identify issues like self-intersections.
- PatchCommand now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole.
- UntrimCommand has been enhanced to create holes instead of only duplicating.
- ExtendCurve command expanded to accept curves in addition to vertices, extending in two directions simultaneously.
- JoinSheetsCommand can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet.
- Shift-x can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking.
- RebuildCommand expanded to replace smoothly connected edges.
- Introduced new edge snaps (closest, perpendicular, tangent) 
- New hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs.
- New hover snaps where curves and edges intersect the construction plane (aka "pierces") and axes.
- The measurements panel now displays angles between two edges-
- Outliner's right-click menu includes a new option to create a group with selected items.
- "Plane from selection" now allows using surface cvs to create construction planes.
- Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation.
- Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.
- ExtendSheetCommand introduced an "up to" behavior for extending surfaces.
- Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.
- Added a warning for unsaved changes when opening files as well as a indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.
- Simplified the PipeCommand gizmo.
- New obj export option: "inflexion".
- Obj export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe. This can be used to check ultra-high-resolution zebras, for example.
- Dimension Command can now resize cylinders 

# Major Enhancements

- Offset Face (push/pull) command now supports dependent offsets.
- Raise Degree Command increases surface complexity by converting analytic surfaces to spline and increasing the spline degree.
- Surface CV editing now allows direct manipulation of both trimmed and untrimmed faces.
- Faces with visible cvs now have a nominal surface to allow easier edits in the presence of direct editing. Remove Nominal SurfaceCommand is available in case it needs to be removed.
- Introduced Toggle Points command to show/hide points on faces, curves, and bodies.
- Added scaling options to the Pipe and Sweep commands.
- Implemented a "Full Round" fillet option.
- Rebuild command now can rebuild the surfaces of faces; extend/and shrink options allow for easily overbuilding surfaces.

Small but Significant Changes

- Dragging CVs of curves and surfaces now aligns with screen space; previously it was parallel to the construction plane
- Enhanced sketch operations to confirm with a single enter press or single left-click.

# Studio-Exclusive Features
- Integrated the xNURBS addon for high-quality surface construction.
- Added support for Rhino 8 imports.

Noteworthy Optimizations
- Enhanced parallelism in OBJ/STL exports.
- Object transformations (move/rotate/scale) now bypass refaceting on confirmation for efficiency.
- Implemented 16-bit snorm normals and 16-bit indices where possible to optimize memory usage.
