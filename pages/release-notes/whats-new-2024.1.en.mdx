Release date: March 5, 2024

## Download and Installation

Plasticity 2024.1 is now available for download. Please refer to [this link](/getting-started/download-and-install) for more details.

## Minor Improvement

### Radial Array 

Improved interactivity of the Radial Array command, allowing you to directly see live interactivity on the viewport.

<VideoPlayer fileName="radial-array-interaction-update-preview"/>

### Planar Face Polygons

Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons.

### Export Dialog

Export dialog now remembers the last used filename.

### Image/OBJ Import

Automatically name imported image/OBJ files based on the original import filename.

### Tangent Circle Command

Extended the Tangent Circle command to construct tangents to three curves/edges. Refer to [here](/tool/tangent-circle).

### New shaders and Built-In Matcaps

Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis and new built-in matcaps for advanced surfacing workflows, including the option to insert custom matcaps. Refer to [here](/plasticity-essential/view-mode).

### Patch Command 

Patch Command now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole.

### Untrim

Untrim Command has been enhanced to create holes instead of only duplicating.

### Extend Curve

Extend Curve command expanded to accept curves in addition to vertices, extending in two directions simultaneously.

### Join Sheet

Join Sheets Command can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet. Refer to [here](/solid/join-sheets).

<VideoPlayer fileName="join-sheet-example"/>

### Point Picking Enhancement

Shift-x can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking.

### Rebuild

Rebuild Command expanded to replace smoothly connected edges. 

### Snapping Features

Introduced new edge snaps (closest, perpendicular, tangent), new hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs and new hover snaps where curves and edges intersect the construction plane (also known as "pierces") and axes.

### Measurement Panel

The measurements panel now displays angles between two edges.

### Outliner

Outliner's right-click menu includes a new option to create a group with selected items.

### Construction Plane

"Plane from selection" now allows using surface cvs to create construction planes.

### OBJ/STL Unit Confirmation

 Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation.

### Improved Panel Interactivity

 Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.

### Extend Sheet

 Extend Sheet Command introduced an "up to" behavior for extending surfaces.

###  STEP Export Enhacement

 Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.

### Warning Indicator for Unsaved Files

 Added a warning for unsaved changes when opening files as well as a indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.

### Command Palette

 Command Palette now highlights in red clashing keybindings.

### Pipe Gizmo

 New simplified gizmo for the Pipe command.

### New OBJ Export Option

 New obj export option: "inflexion".

### OBJ Export Wireframe and Shader

 Obj export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe. This can be used to check ultra-high-resolution zebras, for example.

### Dimension Command Enhancement

 Dimension Command can now resize cylinders. 



## Major Improvement

### Dependent Offset 

Offset Face (push/pull) command now supports dependent offsets. Refer to [here](/solid/offset-face).

<VideoPlayer fileName="dependant-offset-face"/>

### Raise Surface Degree

Raise Degree Command increases surface complexity by converting analytic surfaces to spline and increasing the spline degree. Refer to [here](/solid/raise-surface-degree).

<VideoPlayer fileName="raise-surface-degree"/>

### Surface CV Editing

Surface CV editing now allows direct manipulation of both trimmed and untrimmed faces.

### Nominal Face

Faces with visible cvs now have a nominal surface to allow easier edits in the presence of direct editing. Remove Nominal Surface Command is available in case it needs to be removed. Refer to [here](/solid/remove-nominal-surface).

<VideoPlayer filename="remove-nominal-surface"/>

### Toggle Points

Introduced Toggle Points command to show/hide points on faces, curves, and bodies. Refer to [here](/curve/toggle-points).

<VideoPlayer fileName="toggle-points"/> 

### Pipe and Sweep

Added scaling options to the Pipe and Sweep commands. Refer to [Pipe](/solid/pipe) and [Sweep](/solid/sweeop) for more details.

### Full Round Fillet

Implemented a "Full Round" fillet option. 

The Full Round option has been added to the solid fillet feature. This option gives you the option to create a rounded fillet on a face when two edges are selected.

For more details on Fillet Shell, see [here](/solid/fillet-shell#fillet-options).

### Face Rebuild

Rebuild command now can rebuild the surfaces of faces; extend/and shrink options allow for easily overbuilding surfaces.

<VideoPlayer fileName="rebuild-face"/>


## Studio-Exclusive Features

### xNURBS

Integrated the xNURBS addon for high-quality surface construction.

### Rhino 8 Import

 Added support for Rhino 8 imports.

## Noteworthy Optimizations

Enhanced parallelism in OBJ/STL exports.

Object transformations (move/rotate/scale) now bypass refaceting on confirmation for efficiency.

Implemented 16-bit snorm normals and 16-bit indices where possible to optimize memory usage.


## New Commands 

### Remove Nominal Surface

Remove hiden surface CVs for more control. Only applicable when you've raised surface degree. Refer to [here](/solid/remove-nominal-surface)

### Toggle Points

Toggle on or off CV points on faces, curves, and bodies. Refer to [here](/sketch/toggle-points)

### Rebuild Face

Rebuild a face 

### Raise Degree on Curves and Faces
